# docker-simple-project
Simple docker project. This project formed part of an online course on how to use Docker.

## Overview

This section of the course was the first hands on project of the course and used a basic Node.js Express.js application to illustrate the basic concepts of a Dockerfile.

Deliberate mistakes "common" were made in the initial Dockerfile and then fixed in subsequent lectures.
